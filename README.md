# Database Architecture for ITSM Incident Handling Solution

## Project Overview
This project centers on the creation and deployment of a robust database tailored for an IT Service Management (ITSM) incident management system, utilizing a blend of modeling techniques and technologies.

## Key Features
1. Comprehensive Modeling Integration: The project incorporates ER, EER, and UML models to establish a solid foundation for database design, ensuring efficiency and completeness.
2. MySQL Relational Database Architecture: Implemented with 23 interconnected tables, the MySQL database accommodates diverse data requirements, providing a scalable and structured solution.
3. Python-driven Data Visualization: Python scripts are employed to extract insights and create visual representations, enhancing the interpretability and usability of the database system.

## Development Process
1. Problem Identification: The project began with defining the core objective of designing an ITSM-based incident management system.
2. Conceptual Modeling: Initial phases involved creating conceptual models using EER and UML diagrams, laying the groundwork for database structuring.
3. Relational Model Translation: The conceptual models were translated into a relational model compatible with MySQL database requirements.
4. SQL Implementation: Using MySQL Workbench, the relational model was implemented into a functional database, ensuring accuracy and integrity.
5. Python Implementation: Python scripts were developed to establish MySQL database connections, retrieve data, and generate visual analytics, including pie charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots, offering valuable insights into system performance and operations.
